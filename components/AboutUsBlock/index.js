            <p>TechSearch is a personalized and customized Recruitment Consultancy that was born out of a love for the purity of the Recruitment Process.
            Its founder and Managing Consultant Jeff Bonnin, has over 15 years of Recruitment experience across North America and APAC.</p>
            <p>He has focused mainly in the technology space and is passionate about connecting great people with equally great companies.
            He derives a sense of purpose in knowing he has helped solve critical business issues for organizations while always being guided by a sense of wanting to do the right thing.</p>
            <p>However, through his experience he has sometimes seen the business objectives of Recruitment Agencies and their aim to make a profit have a negative impact on the recruitment process or the recruitment fee be too prohibitive for a company to afford.
            TechSearch was founded with the desire to put solving your Recruitment needs at the core of the relationship.</p>
